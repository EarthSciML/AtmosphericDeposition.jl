The key improvement is  the computation of bulk surface resistances along three distinct pathways of mass transfer to sites of  deposition at the upper portions of vegetative canopies or structures, the lower portions, and the ground  (or water surface). This approach replaces the previous technique of providing simple look-up tables  of bulk surface resistances. With the surface resistances divided explicitly into distinct pathways,  the bulk surface resistances for a large number of gases in addition IO those usually addressed  in acid deposition models (SO2, O3, NOx, and HNO3) can be computed, if estimates of the effective Henry’s Law constants  and appropriate measures of the chemical reactiiity of the various substances are known.  This has been accomnlished successfullv for H2O2, HCHO, CH3CHO (to represent other aldehydes CH3O2H  (to represent organic peroxides), CH3C(O)O2H, HCOOH (to represent organic acids), NH3, CH3C(O)O2NO2,  and HNO2. Other factors considered include surface temperature, stomatal response to environmental parameters,  the wetting of surfaces by dew and rain, and the covering of surfaces by snow. Surface emission of gases  and variations of uptake characteristics by individual plant species within the landuse types are not considered explicitly.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"CurrentModule = AtmosphericDeposition","category":"page"},{"location":"#AtmosphericDeposition","page":"Home","title":"AtmosphericDeposition","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Documentation for AtmosphericDeposition.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"","category":"page"}]
