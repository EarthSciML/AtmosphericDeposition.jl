# Dry Deposition

## Model

This is an implementation of a box model used to calculate changes in gas species concentration due to dry deposition.

## Running the model

Here's an example of how concentration of different species, such as SO₂, O₃, NO₂, NO, H₂O₂, CH₂O and HNO₃change due to dry deposition.

We can create an instance of the model in the following manner:

```julia
using AtmosphericDeposition
using ModelingToolkit
using DifferentialEquations
using EarthSciMLBase
using DynamicQuantities
using ModelingToolkit: t

model = DrydepositionG()
```

Before running any simulations with the model we need to convert it into a system of differential equations.

```julia
sys = structural_simplify(model)
tspan = (0.0, 3600*24)
prob = ODEProblem(sys, [], tspan, []) # default initial concentration of SO₂, O₃, NO₂, H₂O₂, HNO₃, CH₂O
sol = solve(prob, AutoTsit5(Rosenbrock23()), saveat = 10.0) # default parameters 
```

```@setup 1
using AtmosphericDeposition
using ModelingToolkit
using DifferentialEquations
using EarthSciMLBase
using DynamicQuantities
using ModelingToolkit:t

model = DrydepositionG()

sys = structural_simplify(model)
tspan = (0.0, 3600*24) 
prob = ODEProblem(sys, [], tspan, []) # default initial concentration of SO₂, O₃, NO₂, H₂O₂, HNO₃, CH₂O
sol = solve(prob,AutoTsit5(Rosenbrock23()), saveat=10.0) # default parameters 
```

which we can plot as

```@example 1
using Plots
plot(sol, xlabel = "Time (second)", ylabel = "concentration (ppb)", legend = :outerright)
```

## Parameters

The parameters in the model are:

```julia
parameters(sys) # [iLandUse, z, z₀, u_star, L, ρA, G, iSeason, T, θ]
```

where `iLandUse` is the index for the landuse, `iSeason` is the index for the season, `z` is the top of the surface layer [m], `z₀` is the roughness length [m], `u_star` is friction velocity [m/s], and `L` is Monin-Obukhov length [m], `ρA` is air density [kg/m3], `T` is surface air temperature [K], `G` is solar irradiation [W m-2], `Θ` is the slope of the local terrain [radians].

Let's run some simulation with different value for parameter `z`.

```@example 1
@unpack O3, z = sys

p1 = [z=>50]
p2 = [z=>10]
sol1 = solve(ODEProblem(sys, [], tspan, p1), AutoTsit5(Rosenbrock23()), saveat = 10.0)
sol2 = solve(ODEProblem(sys, [], tspan, p2), AutoTsit5(Rosenbrock23()), saveat = 10.0)

plot([sol1[O3], sol2[O3]], label = ["z=50m" "z=10m"],
    title = "Change of O3 concentration due to dry deposition",
    xlabel = "Time (second)", ylabel = "concentration (ppb)")
```
