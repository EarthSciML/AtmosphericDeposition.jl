The key improvement is the computation of bulk surface resistances along three distinct pathways of mass transfer to sites of deposition at the upper portions of vegetative canopies or structures, the lower portions, and the ground (or water surface). This approach replaces the previous technique of providing simple look-up tables of bulk surface resistances. With the surface resistances divided explicitly into distinct pathways, the bulk surface resistances for a large number of gases in addition to those usually addressed in acid deposition models (SO₂, O₃, NOₓ, and HNO₃) can be computed, if estimates of the effective Henry’s Law constants and appropriate measures of the chemical reactivity of the various substances are known. This has been accomplished successfully for H₂O₂, HCHO, CH₃O₂H (to represent organic peroxides), CH₃C(O)O₂H, HCOOH (to represent organic acids), NH₃, CH₃C(O)O₂NO₂, and HNO₂. Other factors considered include surface temperature, stomatal response to environmental parameters, the wetting of surfaces by dew and rain, and the covering of surfaces by snow.
